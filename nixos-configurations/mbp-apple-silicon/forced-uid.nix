      Pin an account to a particular uid, including one below the normal range.

      This exists for filesystems that carry ownership across a boundary
      without translating it. An NFSv3 export hands its client every file's
      numeric owner unchanged, so the client's user sees the files as its own
      only when the account behind them answers to the same number.

      Below 1000 this cannot simply set the uid: nixpkgs asserts that a normal
      user has a uid of at least 1000, so the account has to be declared a
      system user instead. That flips off the six defaults isNormalUser
      supplies, which are restored here as defaults so anything set explicitly
      elsewhere still wins, and it drops the account out of any list derived by
      filtering on isNormalUser - trusted-users among them - which is put back.

      NixOS does not renumber an account that already exists; it warns and
      carries on. An installed system therefore needs a one-time usermod, and
      the activation check below says so with the exact commands.
