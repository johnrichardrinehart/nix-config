  # niri rejects a software EGL device outright - the ensure! near the top of
  # Tty::try_initialize_gpu in src/backend/tty.rs - and QEMU's virtio-gpu has no
  # virglrenderer behind it on a macOS host, so Mesa offers only llvmpipe. The
  # compositor therefore starts with no renderer and no outputs at all, which
  # leaves the SPICE displays blank and makes the guest agent report a 0x0
  # desktop that spice-vdagentd discards as coming from an old agent.
  #
  # base.nix already sets NIRI_ALLOW_SOFTWARE_EGL and pins render-drm-device,
  # but niri honours them only with the two commits of niri-wm/niri#4614,
  # an open pull request that no release includes. Carry them until one does.
  #
  # The hook is pkgs.niri rather than programs.niri.package because
  # greetd+niri.nix derives its compositor with
  # `pkgs.niri.overrideAttrs (old: { patches = (old.patches or []) ++ ... })`,
  # so whatever is added here is carried into the package it actually installs.
  # Neither patch touches a Cargo file, so the cargoDeps hash pinned there
  # stays valid.
